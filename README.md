problem need to solve

expectation - user can see target user of last seen and online status
feature     - online status & last seen
limits      - 0. online status
            - 1. logged in user post their online status 
            - 2. logged in user can see the online status only in chat / same room
enquiry     - 1. how logged in user can post their online status
                - sockets
                - but how ?
                    - when the logged in user land in chat component we will fire 
                      socket.emit("sendStatus", {status: "online"}) send status online
                    - and that event is fired in the backend
                    - and we will check using console logs
                - but is it enough?
                    - No! we will send the back the status to frontend server using sockets again
                    - but how ?
                        - we will add an socket event listener in the frontend
